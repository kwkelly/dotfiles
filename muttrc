#When you operate on a message, by default, Mutt then takes you to the next message automatically. But if the next message includes a big attachment you will be stuck until Mutt finishes downloading the entire attachment, which might take a while and be annoying if you are working online, i.e. with an IMAP mail account. You can prevent this by unsetting the `resolve' variable, i.e.
unset resolve
